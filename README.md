In this directory we create the semi-analytic covariance matrices. The first step is to create Tom's part. This is the part that contains M-lambda scatter, M-c scatter, and miscentering effects.

UNITS:
DeltaSigma stack realizations are saved in units of hMsun/pc^2 comoving.
After merging, the covariance matrices produced here are in units of [Msun/pc^2 physical]^2.
